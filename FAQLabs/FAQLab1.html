    <h2> How to get full credit</h2>
    <div class="guide">
        Generally more of a binary assignment, either you get it working or you don't and as long as you don't forget to submit fully and on time you should be fine.

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>I cannot login and my password is right? </h3>
        <p> Check your syntax, usually you might be entering <code>ssh RCSID@FQDN</code> in my case it will be <code>ssh kcs@kcs.easturpi.com</code> NOT <code>ssh kcs.eastus.rpi.com</code> although, sometimes the ssh without rcsid works as well. most of the time it is this problem.</p>

        <h3>I'm getting the error "access denied"</h3>
        <p>Use <code>sudo command</code>(which means superuser do) before your command, for example: <code>ls</code> becomes <code>sudo ls</code></p>


        <h3>Can I use my existing GitHub account?</h3>
        <p>Yes!, make sure to add rpi as a secondary email</p>

        <h3>I forgot my password fo Azure! Can you login to my instance?</h3>
        <p> We cannot get access to your instance so you have delete and remake it</p>
